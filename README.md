# Coffee-Sales
The dataset is from March 2024, capturing daily transaction data. In this notebook, I have used EDA to discover the customer's purchasing patterns, sales trends, and customer preferences related to coffee products which can aid in the inventory planning.

From the analysis, we have uncovered valuable insights into customer shopping patterns on a daily and weekly basis. 
We have identified the most popular coffee products and observed the shopping trends over time. 
These findings are instrumental in optimizing inventory planning, designing the layout of vending machines, and determining the ideal restock times for coffee products.
